Below is a short summary on the main files and how to run them

All files hypersurface files rely on the evs package from https://github.com/christopherlovell/evstats/tree/main/evstats and all other python files rely on https://synthesizer-project.github.io/synthesizer/getting_started/installation.html

evs_data and tau_minus_20 the base data file used in the hypersurface plot files. Please note the location will likely need to be changed as I hard coded that.

flux_grid_synthesiser is used to generate the npz files which can then be used in the hypersurface plot files.
